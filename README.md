## How to use
The hitchhiker's guide to DevGPT:

1. Initialize a new project typing /project followed by the name and the description like this: `/project MyApp My application is a simple chatbot using GPT2 Italian model`
2. Once you received project composition, files list and order execution just check for needed files and ask one by one this way: `/complete filename`
3. If all provided scripts are working as expected you'are done

### Tips

- you can also ask it to improve a single file by typing `/improve `and paste the file content you want to be improved
- you can ask to add `/logs` and `/debug` snippets for a better troubleshooting
- you can ask to evaluate compute resources needed to run the application by typing `/dim`
- you can ask to create a README.md file for the application Github repo by typing `/repo`

..and much more.. it is continuosly improved for any need ^_^
