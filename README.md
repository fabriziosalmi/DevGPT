## How to Use

Follow this guide to get started with Code Together:

1. **Initialize a Project**: Use the `/project` command followed by the project name and description.  
   Example:  
   ```bash
   /project MyApp "My application is a simple chatbot using the GPT2 Italian model"
   ```
2. **Complete Your Files**: Review the project structure and use `/complete filename` to generate the necessary files.
3. **Finish and Refine**: Use additional commands like `/improve`, `/logs`, `/debug`, or `/dim` to enhance and finalize your project.

### Additional Tips

- **Improve a File**: Type `/improve` followed by the file content to enhance a specific file.
- **Add Logging**: Use `/logs` to insert logging and debugging snippets.
- **Resource Estimation**: Estimate compute resources required with `/dim`.
- **Generate a README**: Create a project README with `/repo`.

...and much more! Code Together is continuously evolving to meet all your development needs.
